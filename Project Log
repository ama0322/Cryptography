    NOTE: VIGENERE_EXPONENTIAL AND VIGENERE_MULTIPLICATIVE NOT WORKING
        They have no access to misc_c functions. Will be fixed when _cy versions of both are created
    Printing out line-profiling to cipher logs
        Can print python functions out to terminal
    Optimize vigenere_c
        At ~10MB/second
    Finish AES
        Finished _aes_on_block
    Replace timing method
        Have a timing method in Cython that is repeatedly called every loop (too inefficient)
