Finish up the decyprtion for vigener_multiplicative and vigenere_exponential


NEED to fix overlap in for vigenere_exponential decryption.
    TRY - in the relevant information file, create a list of numbers. These numbers represent the integer division of
          power result with the length of the character set. Along with the modulo result of the power result with the
          length of the character set, which is given, the original character could be figured out.



NEED TO FINISH vigenere_multiplicative decryption,
               rotation_unknown decryption for ascii and extended ascii
