ALGORITHM GOALS/FIXES:





GENERAL GOALS/FIXES:

    RSA only works part of time. Blocks are sometimes not done correctly.
    Create own ord() and chr() functions that automatically adjusts for surrogates
    Add default keys for everything
    Refine source_location
    Fix formatting of relevant files (probably using .format())




NEED TO ADD:




TRY:
    Stuff with C for optimization








(OLD)

ALGORITHM GOALS/FIXES:
    Whatever was caught by automatic tests
    rsa not working on longer texts (Clarissa.txt ...)
    decrypt vigenere_nokey




GENERAL GOALS/FIXES:
    Add modes of encryption information to relevant info and statistics file
    UPDATE TESTS TO NEW MODE_OF_OPERATION_FORMAT
    mode of encryption setting needs to be added to tests
    database command
    for file paths with spaces, add option to enclose in quotation marks (using escape character right now)
    Add type hints to everything
    Make all encrypt()/decrypt() functions take char_set:str instead of alphabet_size:int





NEED TO ADD:
    Handle failed decryption (because user entered wrong key) for ciphers such as rsa or blowfish that can severely fail




TRY:
    Stuff with C for optimization
