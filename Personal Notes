ALGORITHM GOALS/FIXES:





GENERAL GOALS/FIXES:

    Try to fix long loading times (lazy importing).
    Finish misc.print_updates()

    For test, add a "-f" flag to print out the entire ciphertext/plaintext (is shortened by default).


    Add expressions for determining if block_sizes or key_sizes are okay to be used.
    In testing mode, make a check for asymmetric block ciphers' mode of encryption since they are different from
        symmetric block ciphers.
    Refine source_location
    Fix formatting of relevant files (probably using .format())




NEED TO ADD:




















(OLD)

ALGORITHM GOALS/FIXES:
    Whatever was caught by automatic tests
    rsa not working on longer texts (Clarissa.txt ...)
    decrypt vigenere_nokey




GENERAL GOALS/FIXES:
    Add modes of encryption information to relevant info and statistics file
    UPDATE TESTS TO NEW MODE_OF_OPERATION_FORMAT
    mode of encryption setting needs to be added to tests
    database command
    for file paths with spaces, add option to enclose in quotation marks (using escape character right now)
    Add type hints to everything
    Make all encrypt()/decrypt() functions take char_set:str instead of alphabet_size:int





NEED TO ADD:
    Handle failed decryption (because user entered wrong key) for ciphers such as rsa or blowfish that can severely fail




TRY:
    Stuff with C for optimization
